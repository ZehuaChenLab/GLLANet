# G2L2Net
Road extraction from remote sensing images holds significant application value in various fields. However, due to the diverse shapes of the roads and potential occlusions or interferences from the background, road extraction remains a challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a road extraction network based on Gated Global-Local Linear Attention (G2L2Net). Firstly, we introduce a linear deformable convolution and design a Linear Input-Dependent Deformable Convolution (LID2Conv) by dynamically updating the convolution weights with the image content. In addition, we design a Top K-based sparse gated weight (TGW). We use this gated mechanism as a shared weight to multiply with local and global information to achieve gated global-local linear attention (G2L2Attention). Local information is obtained by LID2Conv and we gain global information by introducing 2D Selective Scan (SS2D). This attention is combined with a multiscale feedforward network for progressive feature extraction. The extracted features are passed to the decoder while preserving global-local information across different feature scales. This approach improves road detail representation and provides accurate contextual information. Experiments conducted on three public road datasets demonstrate that G2L2Net outperforms existing methods in various evaluation metrics.
